"[Title:Highest in the Room] 
[Chorus]
I got room in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It’s lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I’m doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Case it’s fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I’m the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let’s go, yeah)

[Verse 2]
We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot (Yeah)
My block made of quesería

Turn it up 'til they can't hear (We can't)
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real (Gang)

Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas

[Chorus]
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)

"[Title:Star Shopping] 
[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason"

I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine

I fuck her long
Ain’t no Minute Maid
My diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye
Wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate
I’m first to finish, ayy
I’m a young rich nigga
Bitch it’s always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow
Might just be today
So I always live it up
We poppin' bottles
Poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch
I ain’t even had to pay
Had to put on for the team
And had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear robins wings
I can’t stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship
We go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it
I can’t catch a case
Blast off, blast off
See the stars up in Wraith
You can't get into the crib
Because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section
I’m gon' put you in your place
If your club goin' up
You bet I’m sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love
She shook that ass up in my face

[Chorus]
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
(She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed)
(She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed)

I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino

"[Title:Money In The Grave] 
[Intro]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it"

This used to be my favorite time of the morning
Text you like, ""Good morning""
It's been?a?day, we ain't?spoken
All of me feels frozen
How could?you let it go like that?
How come it always goes like that?
Wondering where I mess up at
To always go through it, always go through this
Why I gotta beg to be chosen
Over your vices, over your liquor?
Why I gotta ask for flowers?
I deserve roses, I deserve bigger
I know you're tryna change, but is it all worth the wait?
It hurts to stay just as much as it hurts to walk away

You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop
Man, that shit don't stop

Don't stop

You're still my love, you're still my heart, that's still my dick
Still wanna be Mrs. Jackson, still wanna be your co-captain
So don't lose a girl of your dreams
Waited five years to be on my team
Looked damn good fucking with me
Love how I'm always on twenty
How I keep it tight and cleanly
Fuck you in the truck when it's empty
And I throw it back when you miss me
And I pull up when you hit me
I'ma say it loud so you hear me (Oh)

You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama (I hate drama, no)
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop (Oh no)

Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop
Man, that shit don't stop

I've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems you movin' on from me
Caught you on the scene with little miss thing, and trust me she really don't want beef
That's besides the point, I'm disappointed as a homie, what is it you see?
I want better for you movin' forward, what's better for you than me?

You've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems I'm movin' on my own
The audacity to question me, like you ain't leave me out here on my own
I was traumatized and suicidal, I'm sick and tired, I am not to blame
Once I felt a way but not today, I'm not afraid, now I can say
Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone
I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone
Don't worry about who it is I'm fuckin' or who I am lovin', just know that it is not you
This isn't up for discussion, I wish you good luck, man

You know I had these issues when you met me (Ooh yeah)
Results of those past damages that I haven’t dealt with
And I only want the best for you, movin' forward but you backtracking with niggas that ain't shit for you don't belong around your aura
You know there's not a day in these modern times
You haven't crossed my mind, we both crossed the line
Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself
Just like I always felt like cheatin' on you would be cheatin' myself
To me, that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with
Tryna speak your heart, tryna make your mark
Then go deeper and make a scar
But every time I lay down I think about you naked
And if you find my replacement, how could you?
I made you cum nine times in one day
Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face
I realize you look as good as you taste, hmm (Yeah)
Fingers all in your mouth, I’m grabbin' you up and dickin’ you down
I'm grabbin' your waist, your room is my only escape, I guess that's none of your concern"

Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath

This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)

I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get

I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise

Feds wanna?tap up man and wire up?man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal line me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchy
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip, when we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way-way less
I know you try get one down on us ever since then it's been stressed
'Cause you know the reps dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin'; I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Ring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301 won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting

If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me

I'm at the bank, only time that I'm runnin'
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop
I'm runnin' through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Woah, stop that
Told a fuck nigga just drop that (Yeah)
If you shoot first, we gon' pop back
Margiela on me, lil' nigga, that's not that
What you got on? Prada sweatsuit made of nylon
See my righteous girl, yeah, she say, ""Right on""
When I hit that girl right with the light on
When I hit that girl, oh

Gotta shoot two at her
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (Woah)
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (Woah)

Are you serious?
I swear my money get serious
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearin' it
She suck my dick 'til she get delirious (Woah)

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
""You don't understand me"", what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Uugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

"[Title: No Role Modelz]
[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

"[Title: Lose Yourself]
[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

If you hit, pussy nigga, better stay down
You ain't never moved guns through the Greyhound
You ain't never gon' spin when it came down
And I really wanna hear what you say now

Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot

Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship

Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
""I gotta get the most of everything"" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)

Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'

I just walked off with my son, on top of that he won
I don't talk I got a gun, If we fall off, bitch, we done
Can't fall off, I got funds, I fall off then I'm dumb
Had to run away from my girl, she done ran up out of trust
I done ran up out of love
I done ran up out of love
You said you had enough, so I went out to the club
Can't drink 'cause I'm too young, but today I'm getting drunk
So motherfucking tired, been runnin' all my life
Oh, I've been runnin' all my life
Runnin' all my life
Harriet Tubman, I've been runnin' all my life, ayy
I'm standin' at the stretch line
Kunta Kinte, all my life, I had the fire
In the projects, all my life, I had to grind
Young nigga had to hustle to survive
Remember I was underground, now everybody on my line
Put the hood on TV, every day I'm on the rise
I done rescued all my niggas, you ain't gotta slang that iron
They changed on a nigga, so I left they ass behind

They gave my dawg a long sentence, hit him with the textbook
Hit him with the textbook, he can't even read
His family never finna go seem him, 'cause they sent him way up to Creek
The society corrupted we going through modernized slavery
Sell a black male to a plantation
Like a slave master sell a black male to a plantation
Bust a lick, right on Plantation
Double back, hit a lick right on Plantation
What happened to salvation?

Slim won't show for the video 'cause he terrified of my squad
I heard your chauffeur got a video of you suckin' a cock
You paid him off, then laid him off, now who really the opp?
Suge called me the new Pac, I ain't no killer but don't push me
How the fuck y'all got me battlin' Elvis Pussly? Nigga

[Chorus: Hitman Holla]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand (Yeah)
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (Incredible game)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 2: Hitman Holla]
This gotta be karma 'cause he's shit out of luck
Eminem the perfect name, 'cause this nigga a nut
You used to beef with Nickelodeon Nick
He called Hit and I come with the mop and get on my custodian shit
Like bada-boom, dotted beam, llama sing
Got spazzed, put Eminem in the bag, it's Halloween
This ain't an 8 Mile battle, man, I'll do you awful
My competition in the target, I think it's Marshall, holla

[Chorus: Charlie Clips]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand (Facts)
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (Haha, incredible, I got it)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Verse 3: Charlie Clips & Nick Cannon]
Come on Nick, that's Marshall, you don't need help
Nigga, you a rider? No safety, fuck a seatbelt
What? Is he out of his mind? I got a Glock
And don't Eminem belong on the side of a nine? That's crazy
Man, you act like Nick hurtin' your dreams
You an M&M, how you mad a star burst on the scene? (Haha, you get that?)
Let me find out you still in that trailer park, this how we do
Run up and shoot the trailer (Blaow), this the preview, Clips, nigga

[Chorus: Prince Eazy]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last (I am)
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back (Eazy)

[Verse 4: Prince Eazy]
He ain't really for the culture
Fucked his baby mama in a choker (Choker)
Picked her up like a chauffeur (Skrrt)
On that Twitter wall like a poster (Ugh)
On foenem she'll get cracked like cocaine mixed with soda
When I take her soul, if the bitch die, I'ma still eat her, I'm a vulture
Why Mariah name in your mouth?
You forty-seven chasin' clout
""Obsessed"" came out in '08 and you just puttin' some out? (Damn)
'Cause Marshall think he a ape, but a white boy with a backpack
I do this shit for my real niggas, not the white boys tryna act black, on God (Eazy)

[Chorus]
Hundreds everywhere, now it's money on the bed
I can say I love it, but it's hard to understand
I just want the real, baby, you can have my last
You know, if you go out, baby, ain't no comin' back

[Outro: Suge Knight]
It-it-it's time to sick that ol' buster-ass, motherfucker
But the shit you gotta realize you run that shit out there, man
And at the end of the day, you got every person in the industry and every person in the streets
Shit, where he gon' go? He just the new Vanilla Ice
'Cause it's a matter of time he hangin', right?
Eminem's a bitch for bringin' bullshit up that's not true
Say some shit and then when shit get a little hot, everybody wanna fall back
Or they wanna run around with all these police
You know, that ain't part-you gon' be a rapper
Any time you're a rapper, you shouldn't have a whole bunch of police badges around you
Any time you be a rapper, you're supposed to be able to meet up with motherfuckers and handle your business
But all we gotta do is get that motherfucker in the ring with you and you're gonna beat the dog shit out of him
That motherfuckin' simple
Nick Cannon is a force in it-itself
And if you have proper time for conversation, y'all got the same energy for doin' stuff for the people
He not scared to do stuff for the people
So if this dude want a real target on his back, that's on him
But don't talk no shit and go and hide
And you know what you call a man who ain't gon' stand up and fight? He's a bitch
We should tell the motherfuckers in Detroit he got twenty-four hours to respond or they need kick his ass out that mothafuckin' city
Hahahahaha, haha
You have sixty seconds remaining"

[Verse 1: Charlie Clips]
Lord, forgive us I know that?it's?kinda wrong
For five?brothers this talented to be on?one song (Facts)
But that white boy, he is nice (He is)
But he crossed the black man, Lord Jesus Christ (He gotta go)
We gon' pray for him (Uh), and move Hailie out the way when we spray cans
We don't shoot kids and women (Nah), we shootin' amen (Amen)
Look, that double entendre kinda heavenly (It was)
Damn, Em', what you like five minutes away from seventy? (Oh man, hah)
Oops, I meant forty-seven (Ah)
Send him to Hell if he bored of Heaven (Bored of Heaven)
Strappin' the dynamite, word to Florida Evans (Good times)
I get to grippin' the Glock, he better call a reverend (Raah)
And give Eminem falls and knock him out his Jordan 7's (Woo)
Oh, you got your own sneakers? That's okay (That's wassup)
Well, to let you know, them Wild'n Out Jordans is on the way (Facts)
Nah, I ain't do this verse for the fame or the clout (Not at all)
I did this verse to say keep my brother name out your mouth (Ah, incredible)

[Verse 2: Hitman Holla]
I mean at this point it's bullyin', 'cause I know he ain't gon' clap back
So I don't be dealin' with these rap cats
I'm the best and that's that
Put that on everything, and my CashApp
A bunch of red rags and black 'Lacs
Incredible, they catch me with this, I'm goin' federal
I've been a star, your favorite actress wanna get sexual
You've been afraid, Em', this ain't that renegade, Em
Where you ain't perc’d up, you sweeter than lemonade, Em'
Black Squad, you won't link with them
See, you tried to bully P!nk and them
Britney Spears and N*SYNC and them
And got the beefin' with Ja Rule with the cops behind you
And every show since '04, you've had the SWAT behind you
Man, y'all find a all-time great in a small town lake
I hawk 'em down with the K
Don't you got a cash flow? What the fuck you mad for?
Subtract you, add a casket, that's the aftermath, ho, Holla

[Verse 3: Conceited]
Hi Slim, let's kill it with all the chit-chat
Eminem, but you get the sticks, now that's a Kit Kat (Kat)
So, wait, dammit, you mad that you ain't Cannon
All them pills, you stay crammin' still givin' you brain damage (B-B-Brain damage)
Your guilty conscience told you, you was the man and all
But now you just a circus act, 'cause you stay up on cannonballs (Balls)
You always hide in your trailer, we know you big mad (Mad)
Get your bitch to run in our lap like this is gym class (Woo)
'Cause all my niggas just stand up like Sinbad
Big Mac in the cans that get rid of slim fast (Blah)
Instead of stayin' in the booth to get your rhymin' out
It's season 15, here's your invite to Wild'n Out

Ain't no backdoorin', 'cause all of my troops thurl (Thorough)
Ain't got no bitch, Glock Nina, my new girl (off on her)
I'm sick of all my homies keep dyin', might puke Earl (Eugh)
God should've took Em' and just let us keep Juice WRLD
Look, Nick, my brother, you dissed him, that gotta suffer
I told him, ""Don't diss you back, let us handle this motherfucker""
Look, I scratched the serial number up off the baby llama
Em' ain't seen a ratchet this dirty since his baby-mama

[Interlude: Nick Cannon]
Goddamn, y'all niggas ain't had to do him like that
Shit, we don't do it, we over-do it
You play fucked up games, win fucked up prizes
All this cocaine out here, and you wanna put your nose in my business
Told you, I ain't had to rap on this motherfucker
You know what? I'm not gon' rap
I'ma just do what you did, haha

[Verse 5: Nick Cannon]
You used to be in a position to talk to kids and they listen
Now you a politician? You voted for Trump, bitch, admit it (Ha)
They used to call you a menace and that shoe fit you wore (Not no more)
But now you gettin' facelifts like a Instagram-whore (Yoy bitch)
Used to be the king of the rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Now all you do is just growl
Like you got Tourettes and hysterics
Maybe it's your mommy issues (Haha)
Maybe your white devilish spirit (You the devil)
He made the original music that your fans used to cherish
Now you're debated, disputed, hated
And viewed in America as a motherfuckin' drug addict (Bitch)
You'll never be a legend (Marshall)
Em', you should really start to stare at who's in the mirror
Look at all the fuckin' botox, bitch, I know you're embarrassed (Hahaha)
Fuck all the tricks and the gimmicks
You like the new white supremacist
Say the same fuckin' sentences
Nigga, you ain't no lyricist
Lam, blam, flam, flam, take Xans and Trans-Ams
I bet you never thought the kill shot will come from the cannon, blaow

Look you?in?your eyes, say?they love you, just don't believe?them
In the trenches gotta play 'em close like you need 'em
Chest pain, I was sippin' lean by the liter
How you screamin' that you got some killers? You don't feed them
Booka steady trippin' when I say I don't believe in Jesus
Don't ever put your all into a bitch 'cause she gon' leave you
And I know a couple Atlanta hoes that wear her lashes
In the trap, I fuck the baddest bitches on the mattress
Given to the trenches, took advantage of my kindness
I done gave a nigga a lot of pounds without askin'
Government did that shutdown, he got his time in
Damn well, he don't 'posed to be on home confinement
Killers right on standby, go off my word just like Simon
I can judge a nigga by his character off his diamonds
I know a nigga, he shootin' dice with the T's
But how you say that when I give him all he needs?
And even though he ain't show no love, I tried to reach
In commonwealth, he took a dub, nigga, please

Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon' hate on you?
For that check, I'll hire your day ones to lay on you
Is they keepin' it one thousand like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannies
Told you I ain't friendly, it's Only the Family
Is it possible you gon' ride? Is it possible you gon' ride?

Out on 1300, so don't act like you can't find us
Tim-Tim lost his life, I bang the same block he died for
September 18th, ain't that the same shit we cried for?
My lil' niggas got to slidin' when them tears dried up
Made it out the trenches, we young vets and survivors
Learned so much from that corner, bumped my head, but now I'm wiser
Chasin' after trends, I risked my freedom for designer
Almost lost my life, got down, and I was on that timer
Now I hit up Treasures with a hundred thousand on me
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm with blast all by my lonely
Loyalty dyin' slow, you gotta watch out for your homies
If any nigga play, a dead man is what he gon' be

Grew up with Big L and the dude supposedly killed him
A week before that though, Big L had tried to kill him
That's what I heard, please don't get in ya feelings
When the time's right I will tell you about these villains
And everybody dead, so it ain't about squealin'
Weapons we conceal 'em, need be, reveal 'em
Fly, nah, fly traps was hangin' from the ceiling
Milk and Giz was chillin', me and Biz was illin'
Love my hood but to make it out, woo, what a feeling
I couldn't sleep at night, in my bed I would keep a knife
Until I got a gun, where I'm from they ain't believe in life
Cops come readin' rights, but we ain't the readin' type
You don't need Adidas or a zebra, see my stripes
Goddamn, you got to feel me brother

No slouch or homicide to vouch ya

8th Ave, dipped up, in my waist the grip tucked
Told me keep my lips shut I ever get picked up

Just wanted to chill, now in this shit I'm mixed up
You know Max B, I call him Charlie Rambo
Lived in the same building, you would call a bando
Outside more gunshots than Commando
That's why I had to treat myself to Porsches, Lambos
Pardon, I get emotional
It's all real, none of it is promotional
Just wanted to play basketball and have an ocean view
But when you live where I live, what the fuck you supposed to do?
Fast forward, Fort Lee, New Jersey, my triplex
Son just born, formula by the Pyrex
Liquidated money, the drugs from them big checks
Been solidified way before Dipset
No disrespect to the brotherhood
They're my brothers, but brother I'm from another hood
Where it ain't fair, like Blair they leave you under wood

This is dedicated
To the memoir of my niggas, them
Most of them victimized because the daily grind
Crackers be bamming and sending them
Down to the county
Face down on the pavement
Blackland, Carol City
My visual it's the same shit
Still the same little niggas going to the candy lady
25 for that frozen cup
Crackers be thinking they trapping
Just post in the Charger until they are ready to jump
Jump out the jumper, no pulling your gun out
You better be sprinting the other way
Throw out the fire, get caught by the nine
Run through alley ways all in Cherry Bay
It's real in the field, either kill or be killed
Like BG so they got a grip on the tec
Took my nigga, Chynaman, took my nigga, PJ
And Trayvon, hot damn, who next on a white tee?
Born and raised on the Zone 3
Blackland right by the 199
Pull out the stick if you 'bout that life
Seen niggas from the Four be toting that iron
Run down, catch a nigga by sundown
Or downtown when he think the shit is serene
Got that boy when they shot that boy
Then they put him in the trash when they slide by the Beanz
Swerve, soon as I peel off the curve
Burn the evidence then a nigga hide
Take 27? Nah nigga, fuck that
Let's take that chance on the I-95
Bumping that sickest shit with the vomit spit
And a 666 with a twist and twirl
If you survive homicide drive-by
They'll leave you with nubs like the Powerpuff Girls
I get so high, stay so high
Until I see the face of God
Welcome to South Florida
Let that AK rip on the whole damn squad
