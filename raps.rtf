[Verse 1]\par
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get\par
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip\par
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip\par
I ain\rquote t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish\par
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death\par
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich\par
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?\par
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?\par
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit\par
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips\par
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist\par
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift\par
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss\par
They act like two legends cannot coexist\par
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'\par
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit\par
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame\par
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same\par
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers\par
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane\par
Everything grows, it's destined to change\par
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came\par
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can\par
I hope you know money won't erase the pain\par
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now\par
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground\par
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style\par
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now\par
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice\par
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise\par
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions\par
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice\par

Niggas been countin' me out\par
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips\par
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list\par
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit\par
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit\par
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit\par
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty\par
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick\par

[Chorus]\par
I just poured somethin' in my cup\par
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\par
Promise I am never lettin' up\par
Money in your palm don't make you real\par
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck\par
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel\par
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck\par
Pistol in your hand don't make you real\par

[Verse 2]\par
I'm dead in the middle of two generations\par
I'm little bro and big bro all at once\par
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage\par
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch\par
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak\par
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville\par
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest\par
I wish that he had more guidance, for real\par
Too many niggas in cycle of jail\par
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell\par
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma\par
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal\par
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well\par
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well\par
Distorted self image, we set up to fail\par
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga\par

I just poured somethin' in my cup\par
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\par
